# Project Euler - Problem 006: Sum Square Difference
#
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
# Solution: 25164150

sum = 0
sum_squares = 0

for i in range(1,101,1):
    sum = sum + i
    sum_squares = sum_squares + (i*i)

difference = (sum*sum) - sum_squares
print(difference)
