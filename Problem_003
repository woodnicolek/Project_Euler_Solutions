# Project Euler - Problem 003: Largest Prime Factor
#
# The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
#
# What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?
# Solution: 6857


# METHOD 1
# Method 1 gives the correct answer but is slow and inefficient because it runs through all the numbers twice.
